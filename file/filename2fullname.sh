This script finds all files in the current working directory, modifies their 
paths to replace / with ยง and remove the directory path, and then copies each
file to a new file with the modified path as its name. Note that this script may
fail if the modified filenames conflict with existing filenames. Also, this 
script does not create the necessary directories for the new files, so if the
directories do not already exist, the cp command will fail. Be careful when
running this script as it can modify your file system. Always make sure to have
a backup of your files before running scripts that modify them.
