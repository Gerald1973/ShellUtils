Script for Backing Up Git Repositories

This script provides a way to easily back up a Git repository by creating a
compressed archive.

How it works:

The script performs a clone of the specified repository into a temporary 
directory. This creates a complete copy of the repository's history and files.

Example:

Bash
./backup_git_repository.sh https://url.git mydirectory

This command will:

Clone the repository located at https://url.git

Create a compressed archive (ZIP file) named mydirectory.zip containing the 
cloned repository.
Important: Delete the temporary directory where the repository was cloned 
(mydirectory in this example).

Important Note:

This script creates a backup of the entire repository, including all branches, 
tags, and commit history.
The script deletes the temporary directory used for cloning after creating the
archive.
